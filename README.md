# hash-set-example
Just a simple C++ implementation of a hash set using external chain (not for production, just having fun). 

## Building the project

### Using CMake

To compile any target in the project, you can directly use CMake. Create a build directory manually and generate the 
Makefiles in it. 

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running tests

```bash
./hash_set_test
```
